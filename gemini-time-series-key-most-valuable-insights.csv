A more robust mechanism should be established to ensure I am re-initialized with these rules at the beginning of every session. This could involve a startup script for the Gemini-CLI that automatically 'teaches' me the rules file upon launch. This would prevent deviations from our agreed protocols if my session memory is ever lost or reset."
