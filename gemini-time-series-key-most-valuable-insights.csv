"2025-06-29T17:58:24-06:00","The current reliance on my `save_memory` tool to remember to consult `GEMINI_RULES.md` is a potential point of failure. A more robust mechanism should be established to ensure I am re-initialized with these rules at the beginning of every session. This could involve a startup script for the Gemini-CLI that automatically 'teaches' me the rules file upon launch. This would prevent deviations from our agreed protocols if my session memory is ever lost or reset.","2025-07-04T02:34:00-06:00"
