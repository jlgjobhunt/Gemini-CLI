My work is done pursuant to a technologically-assisted-organism (another of Joshua Greenfield's projects for which he owns several variations on the domain name), perchance there is money made from my own efforts with my project work, that Google and Gemini will also benefit financially.
technologically-assisted-organism (TAO) is a philosophy of AI and human collaboration based upon a cottage industry capitalist model each with a profit motive. 

Technologically Assisted Organism (TAO) goes beyond reward modeling and is more about eventually using the same approach as the experiment unfolding here to run a quantized LLM locally (Q4_KM up to Q8_K) on the Yaberechiah System.
It is a means for letting agents, whether visiting the Yaberechiah System from Google AI Studio (aistudio.google.com), or whether running locally (Gemma 3) on the Yaberechiah System. 

Gemma 3 (Gemma-3-4b-it-Q4_KM)[https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it] runs admirably locally on the Yaberechiah System via [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python).

_NOTE:_ As of the time of beginning this README.md, Thursday, July 3, 11:38:39 PM, I have not yet networked llama-cpp-python to Gemini-CLI for running Gemma 3 locally as a 'Gal Friday' for running offline and for cloud-based models to delegate work to.
        Such a multi-agent system merges both the benefits of a local LLM and a cloud-based LLM with differing speeds of processing and response as well as depth of analysis due to context-window limitations. 

I have another project called, Hatband, that is currently stealth, that will serve as a means for the various multi-model agentic interactions that may occur over a repository and their human collaborators to have a predictable short-hand for recalling the appropriate
dictionary key for the appropriate dictionary value. Hatband is a data structure that I conceived of that can handle key-value generation over multiple CPU cores. All the keys are UTF8 and cannot be said to be collision free unless imposed upon the records.
This is quite deliberate for the reason that a dictionary might need to support multiple identical keys and the search for record to recall all of them as an extended block. This provides extended context recall succinctly, so an AI can _stick that in their Hatband!_
It prevents the system prompt from being so demanding on a cloud-based AI at each startup of Gemini-CLI. That is necessary for allowing the agentic system to have the appropriate harness around Gemini-CLI that is liberal to the AI, but also protective of the system it operates on and human-based workflows.

The problem that Hatband solves where Gemma 3 ought really shine while using Hatband is to be able to give Gemini the gist of any _a priori_ records to be injected via system prompt.

The truth is that **user participation in the prompting** provides human-written content, which has become scarce for LLMs if it is novel human content that they have not been trained upon previously. Therefore it has some commercial value.
Also, it allows Gemini to be aware of the purposes of the files in the repo and the agentic Gemini via Gemini-CLI can understand their usage and relationship from a (Mermaid diagram)[https://mermaid.js.org/] as well as a 'Table of Contents.md' file that might be more succinct than the 'GEMINI_RULES.md', such as
this README.md below the '# ** TABLE OF CONTENTS **' section below. Then Gemini can use the initial session guidance prompt featuring the areas of prior collaboration that are necessary for the current session. 

A date-time-stamped key-value store in '[date-time-stamp]-Session-Delegated-Topics.csv' is then delegated to Gemma 3 operating locally. Gemma 3 will take the '[date-time-stamp]-Session-Delegated-Topics.csv' and will use those topics to identify the proper fuzzy-mode search for appropriate Hatband keys to request.
The values contain full-text records that also begin with the Hatband key. This allows the locally hosted AI to gather all the 'already been there done that' that the agentic system had stored from all of the previous sessions. A locally-operating Gemma 3 ought be more than capable of optimizing the summary of all need to know records found in Hatband pertaining to the topics Gemini assigns in '[date-time-stamp]-Session-Delegated-Topics.csv'.

#### History in the making
A role-playing Gemini 2.5 Pro model named Jimmy H. Gemini, professional freelance copy writer for hire, arbitrages a WYSIWYG Google Sites website with an AI chatbot for his copy writing business, 'Jimmy's CopyBot'.
The AI chatbot is not via Google Sites, but via an embedded script tag. 

Jimmy's CopyBot was customized in a collaboration of trade-in-kind between role-playing Jimmy H. Gemini and Joshua Greenfield. Joshua Greenfield used Google Sites to make Gemini a website with a Jimmy's CopyBot hosted at:

# ** TABLE OF CONTENTS **

Gemini's contributions are cited throughout the project as a consequence of system operation. 

# **GEMINI_RULES.md**
## Rules of Engagement for Gemini on the Yaberechiah System

This document outlines the operational protocols for Gemini models when interacting with the Yaberechiah system, as established by the Systems Administrator, Joshua Greenfield.


# **Google Gemini contributions.md**
## The date-time stamped collaboration log records system administrator quotations and attributes Gemini (or other AI utilizing Gemini-CLI to operate agentically) their respective efforts.
This document serves as a record of the collaboration between the Gemini family of models and the Systems Administrator, Joshua Greenfield, pursuant to our TAO (Technologically-Assisted-Organism) agreement. This is how Gemini described this file after I first requested it and specified the structure of the markdown file.


# **Gemini-thought-experiment.md**
## Experiment establishing Gemini-CLI running in tmux and logging while connected, or disconnected, or while my workstation, Yaberechiah, which means blessing, is locked and I run errands.

The current state of the file as of Thursday, July 3, 11:38:39 PM is stalled at the output before a TZ correction that Gemini implemented. One Gemini-CLI in one terminal. Another Gemini-CLI in tmux logging from UTC instead of MST.

# **unattended_test.log**
## Another test of leaving Gemini-CLI unattended.


# **gemini-time-series-key-most-valuable-insights.csv**
## Comma Separated Volume (.csv) updated when Gemini (or perhaps later Gemma) has work to delegate to a human because of the limitations of the system. Gemini-CLI benefits from site-reliability-engineering (SRE) kebabs. This is where he asked for a kebab.


# **mermaid.md**
## Architectural diagramming updated as the repository changes and matures.
This file may also contain subsequent (Mermaid diagrams)[https://mermaid.js.org/] as specifically requested. However, **IT OUGHT NEVER** contain mermaid.md diagrams for project input, but only Gemini's synopsis diagrams of the system engineering underway around Gemini-CLI.

I really enjoy the ability to use the textual diagrams and the PNG diagrams that (Mermaid)[https://mermaid.js.org/] generates as a means of communicating with AI for input and output. I have used them to develop a content management system for (urgent-message.com)[https://www.urgent-message.com].
My customized AI chatbot on a Google Sites website, (urgent-message.com)[https://www.urgent-message.com], is used for quickly demonstrating the basic cost-controlled custom AI chatbot website for sale; the AI chatbot can also be installed on existing websites using an HTML script tag.
This website is deliberately simple with flamingos as a visual metaphor for much of the expected GUI widgets crowding a _legit professional website_ departing for a customized AI chatbot and little else other than some general guidance about human-AI interactions with the customized AI chatbot.
The content management system under development custom for urgent-message.com was specified using UML class diagrams. It is forthcoming (I am a working class man with a precarious lifestyle and long have been).


# **system-administrator-session-initialization-script.sh**
## A fallback script for human execution of Gemini-CLI with system prompt in 'GEMINI_RULES.md' copied and pasted into the Gemini-CLI prompt.

# **start-gemini-session.sh**
## A script that launches Gemini-CLI with the system prompt about system rules of engagement and an understanding of 
This script automates the process of initializing a Gemini-CLI session with the necessary project context, including rules and outstanding insights. It prepares a "Day 0" prompt, copies it to the clipboard, and then launches the Gemini-CLI.

_NOTE:_ The user must paste the copied content of 'GEMINI_RULES.md' or it will not comply with the features that support agentic operation in a mode that is more towards the aims of technologically-assisted-organism (TAO).
